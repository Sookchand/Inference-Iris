# Inference: Iris Classification Using NaÃ¯ve Bayes
This is a solution to the Iris dataset classification problem using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the Naive Bayes model is then fit to the training set. The model is then used to predict the labels of the testing set and the accuracy, confusion matrix, prior, mean, and variance are computed. Finally, a graph is plotted to visualize the results.
